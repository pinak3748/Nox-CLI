# 🚀 Nox CLI – Web Dev, Simplified

Hey, you! Welcome to **Nox**, your new best friend in web development. Need a fast, modern setup for your web app? Nox has your back. Less time fiddling with boilerplates, more time doing what you love – writing glorious code! 

## 🛠️ What’s Inside the Nox Boilerplate?

When you run Nox, it dishes out a feature-rich, modern boilerplate that’ll make your dev friends jealous:

- **React + TypeScript**: Like peanut butter and jelly, but for your code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: CSS, but like on rocket fuel (minus the rage quits).
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management that won’t make you cry.
- **shadcn/ui**: Makes other UI libraries look like they’re from the stone age.

Think of it like a five-course meal for your web app – React’s the entrée, TypeScript’s the safety net, Tailwind’s the flair, Redux keeps you sane, and shadcn/ui is the fancy garnish.

### 🍭 Bonus Features:
- **Style Guide Route**: `/style-guide` — a one-stop shop for all your components.
- **Custom Components**: Pre-made components so you can skip the boring bits.
- **Authentication Flow**: Sign in, sign up, password reset... the whole shebang!

When you generate a new page with Nox, it sets up everything you need: Redux files, React components, and a nice modular structure. You get to jump right into the fun part!

## 🔥 Custom Components

Here’s what we’ve cooked up for you already:

- [x] **signIn** (_/sign-in_) — Because people need to log in, apparently.
- [x] **signUp** (_/sign-up_) — Let the onboarding fun begin.
- [x] **forgotPassword** (_/forgot-password_) — Oops, did you forget again?
- [x] **resetPassword** (_/reset-password_) — Reset. Restart. Repeat.
- [x] **styleGuide** (_/style-guide_) — Keep things looking sharp.
- [ ] **GPTPlayground** (_/gpt-playground_) — AI magic, incoming.
- [ ] **timeLine** (_/time-line_) — For those who need to visualize their life choices.

## ⚡ Features

- **Page Creation**: One command, and boom, you’ve got a new page.
- **Redux Files**: Automatically set up for you (because who likes manual setup?).
- **Modular Structure**: Clean, organized, and ready to scale.
- **Consistency**: Your file structure will be so neat, Marie Kondo would approve.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Install Nox (you’ve got Go installed, right?), and let’s get rolling:

```bash
go get -u github.com/yourusername/nox
```

## 🎛️ Nox Commands

### The Big One:
- `nox` — It’s the magic wand.
  - `--page` or `-p`: Creates a shiny new page for you.
  - `--version` or `-v`: Tells you what version of Nox you’re rocking.

### 💡 Future Ideas:
[ ] Dynamic component creation (because why stop at pages?).
[ ] Alias support (because who doesn’t love shortcuts?).
[ ] Specify output directories and templates.
[ ] Improved `init` command to set up project type, package manager, and more.

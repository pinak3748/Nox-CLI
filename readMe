🚀 Nox CLI – Web Dev, Simplified
Hey, you! Welcome to Nox, your new best friend in web development. Need a fast, modern setup for your web app? Nox has your back. Less time fiddling with boilerplates, more time doing what you love – writing glorious code!

🛠️ What’s Inside the Nox Boilerplate?
When you run Nox, it dishes out a feature-rich, modern boilerplate that’ll make your dev friends jealous:

React + TypeScript: Like peanut butter and jelly, but for your code.
Tailwind CSS: CSS, but like on rocket fuel (minus the rage quits).
Redux Toolkit: State management that won’t make you cry.
shadcn/ui: Makes other UI libraries look like they’re from the stone age.
Think of it like a five-course meal for your web app – React’s the entrée, TypeScript’s the safety net, Tailwind’s the flair, Redux keeps you sane, and shadcn/ui is the fancy garnish.

🍭 Bonus Features:
Style Guide Route: /style-guide — a one-stop shop for all your components.
Custom Components: Pre-made components so you can skip the boring bits.
Authentication Flow: Sign in, sign up, password reset... the whole shebang!
When you generate a new page with Nox, it sets up everything you need: Redux files, React components, and a nice modular structure. You get to jump right into the fun part!

🔥 Custom Components
Here’s what we’ve cooked up for you already:

 signIn (/sign-in) — Because people need to log in, apparently.
 signUp (/sign-up) — Let the onboarding fun begin.
 forgotPassword (/forgot-password) — Oops, did you forget again?
 resetPassword (/reset-password) — Reset. Restart. Repeat.
 styleGuide (/style-guide) — Keep things looking sharp.
 GPTPlayground (/gpt-playground) — AI magic, incoming.
 timeLine (/time-line) — For those who need to visualize their life choices.
⚡ Features
Page Creation: One command, and boom, you’ve got a new page.
Redux Files: Automatically set up for you (because who likes manual setup?).
Modular Structure: Clean, organized, and ready to scale.
Consistency: Your file structure will be so neat, Marie Kondo would approve.
🚀 Getting Started
Install Nox (you’ve got Go installed, right?), and let’s get rolling:

bash
Copy code
go get -u github.com/yourusername/nox
🎛️ Nox Commands
The Big One:
nox — It’s the magic wand.
--page or -p: Creates a shiny new page for you.
--version or -v: Tells you what version of Nox you’re rocking.
What’s Coming:
 Dynamic component creation (because why stop at pages?).
 Alias support (because who doesn’t love shortcuts?).
 Specify output directories and templates.
 Improved init command to set up project type, package manager, and more.
💡 Future Ideas
Here’s what’s on the horizon:

Use your own templates, because custom is cool.
API setup made easy (backend people, we see you).
Start fresh projects with just a few clicks.
More tests, because breaking things is fun, but fixing them is better.
Want to add your own Nox features? We’ll make that happen.
